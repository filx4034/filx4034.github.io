      <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured I should probably introduce myself properly, since it could be very difficult to actually get a feeling for what kind of person I am through the thousands of posts on my Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is mostly irrelevant. My real name is Felix (I&amp;rsquo;m not revealing anything too crazy, I think the name is quite common). At least in Germany, where I live. My real name isn&amp;rsquo;t really what I go by on most sites. That would be either Fistus or filx4034. The latter is simply the result of me smashing my head into my keyboard when creating my Twitter account and the website just automatically added the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
